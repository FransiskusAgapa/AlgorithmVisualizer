### The Customer Journey (Explained Simply)

---

#### Step 1: You open the website

- You land on a page that **feels chill and simple**, with a soft background and a friendly message like:
  > *‚Äúüß† Visualize Algorithms Calmly‚Äù*

- You already feel it‚Äôs not trying to stress you out like textbooks do.

---

#### Step 2: Choose what you want to learn

- There‚Äôs a **dropdown menu** that says:  
  > *‚ÄúChoose Algorithm‚Äù*

- You click it and see options like:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - BFS (graph)
  - DFS (graph)

- Let's say you pick **Bubble Sort**.

---

#### Step 3: Click **Start**

- You hit the **Start** button.
- The screen below begins showing **colored bars** (like Lego bricks).
- Some bars start **glowing or moving** ‚Äî this shows how Bubble Sort compares and swaps items step by step.
- You **see the algorithm in action** rather than trying to imagine it in your head!

---

#### Step 4: Relax and watch

- There's no pressure. You can just:
  - **Pause** if it's too fast
  - **Reset** to try again
  - Adjust the **speed slider** if you want it slower or faster
- You‚Äôre *watching the logic* ‚Äî like seeing a puzzle solve itself.

---

#### Optional: Click **Dark Mode**

- If you're using the app at night or prefer darker backgrounds, you can hit the **"üåô Toggle Dark Mode"** button at the top.
- Instantly the whole site changes to a soft dark theme ‚Äî your eyes thank you.

---

#### Step 5: Try another algorithm

- After finishing Bubble Sort, you‚Äôre curious.
- You go back to the dropdown and pick **DFS (graph)**.
- Now you see **circles and lines** (like nodes and paths).
- You click Start, and you see how the algorithm explores the graph ‚Äî **one node at a time**.

### Why This App Feels Good to Use

- You don‚Äôt feel rushed.
- You don‚Äôt need to know code.
- You can **see** how sorting or graph searching works.
- It‚Äôs **interactive**, and you‚Äôre learning by doing.
- It feels like a **visual game**, not a math exam.
