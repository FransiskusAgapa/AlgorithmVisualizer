# Algorithm Visualizer - Calm & Clear Learning

An interactive and beginner-friendly website to **visualize sorting and graph algorithms** in a calm, stress-free environment. Built for students who want to *see* how algorithms work, not just read about them.

## Why This App Exists

Learning algorithms can be **confusing** and **stressful** when all you see are lines of code or textbook diagrams.

This app:
- **Visually explains** each step of popular algorithms.
- **Feels calm and friendly**, with soft colors and smooth animations.
- Is perfect for **students, self-learners, or anyone preparing for coding interviews**.

## Tech Stack

| Layer      | Tech Used       |
|------------|------------------|
| Frontend   | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| UI Design  | Vanilla CSS (light/dark theme) |
| Animations | DOM manipulation for real-time updates |
| Deployment | GitHub Pages (or Netlify, Vercel, etc.) |

---

## How It Works

1. **Choose an algorithm** from the dropdown menu (e.g., Bubble Sort, DFS).
2. Click **Start** to begin the animation.
3. Watch the algorithm visually perform its logic step-by-step.
4. Use **Reset** to start over or toggle **Dark Mode** for better night-time viewing.

Each algorithm uses simple visuals:
- **Bars** for sorting.
- **Circles and lines** for graph traversal.

This way, you **learn by watching** ‚Äî just like watching how dominoes fall or puzzles solve themselves.

## Possible Future Improvements

- Add more algorithms (Dijkstra‚Äôs, A* pathfinding, Heap Sort)
- Allow color themes and animation styles
- Let users input their own numbers or graphs
- Improve mobile optimization
- Add short explanations or mini-quizzes after each algorithm
- Add sound cues for swaps or visits (optional)
- ‚ÄúLearn Mode‚Äù vs ‚ÄúChallenge Mode‚Äù (like a game!)

As always made with üíô to make learning algorithms **less scary and more satisfying**.
